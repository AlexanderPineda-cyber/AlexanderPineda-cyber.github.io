* Lab 2, part 2 was my favorite because this was when I first started to get my bearings in programming. This was the first time I wrote a function in my programming career. The finished product was a madlib that I was very proud of to run for the first time.

* Lab 4, part 1 was my second favorite lab, as this was the lab where I learned I could define a function in one file and use it in another file. This lab was especially cool because I used functions to convert milliliters to tablespoons, ounces, and cups. This lab was also the first time I used arithmetic operators in a function.

* Lab 3, part 2 was my third favorite lab because this was when I learned how complicated functions could get. I was able to code a function that converted a regular day into a Julain Calendar Day. I also wrote a function that would be able to print the date difference between the start Julian Calendar Day and the end Julian Calendar Day.
